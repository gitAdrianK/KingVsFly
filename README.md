## Introduction
The Babes are rescued, the merchants have gone home, the items are collected, the secrets are uncovered, but there is one loose end... the fly.
The time has come for it to pay for the heinous crime that is mocking the KING!

## Gameplay
Chase the fly up one of the towers until it can no longer avoid its fate.
Introduces the checkpoint system that resets you to the last position you chased the fly away at should you fall.
The mod keeps score of your lowest amount of resets to the checkpoint.

## How to play
The mod can be found and enabled from the Workshop -> Mod menu.
If you are sure you can take it the checkpoint system can be disabled.

## Be aware of
This mod does not save (yet, unsure if it ever will), it is supposed to be played in a single sitting.
While the mod doesn't save, Jump King sure still does, so be aware that you do not have a run going you want to keep.
Using the checkpoint is the intended gameplay so that you have to navigate backwards and can't just fall down and reclimb to the fly, the checkpoint will also reset you when trying to enter the final screen w/o the fly bein there too, this is to avoid a softlock when entering the trigger for the (now removed) babe. Not using the checkpoint will not protect you from this softlock, now that you know that (because you actually read this) walking into the softlock is your own fault :)

Art donations are appreciated, lmao
