## Introduction
The Babes are rescued, the merchants have gone home, the items are collected, the secrets are uncovered, but there is one loose end... the fly.
The time has come for it to pay for the heinous crime that is mocking the KING!

## Gameplay
Chase the fly up one of the towers until it can no longer avoid its fate.
Introduces the checkpoint system that resets you to the last position you chased the fly away at should you fall.

## How to play
The mod can be found and enabled from the Workshop -> Mod menu.
If you are sure you can take it the checkpoint system can be disabled.

## Be aware of
This mod does not save (yet, unsure if it ever will), it is supposed to be played in a single sitting.
While the mod doesn't save, Jump King sure still does, so be aware that you do not have a run going you want to keep.
You'll get teleported every now and then skipping screens that have no real way for you to fall out off or cannot be entirely backtracked to the beginning platform.

Art donations are appreciated, lmao
